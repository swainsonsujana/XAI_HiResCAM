This study can be executed by following these steps:

1. Download the dataset from the kaggle link provided in readme.md
2. Unzip the files and make it ready
3. Build the CNN model by executing CNN_Model.py. Make sure you set the path names correctly wherever required.
4. To generate the class activation maps for a positive prediction, execute class_activation_maps.py
5. Here load the CNN model and choose an image(autistic) to be explained using XAI 
6. Generate Gradient map, CAM++, guided_CAM and HiResCAM and save them in 3D file format(.nii)
7. To validate the genrated CAM maps, execute the CAM_validation.py file(Set the paths correctly for the CAM maps)
8. Sample output images are available at /samples folder
